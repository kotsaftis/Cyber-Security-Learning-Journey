# Sructure Of Infosec

Client: This is a PC/Laptop through which you access resources and services "on the Internet"  

Internet: This is a vast, interconnected network of servers that offer different services and applications, such as Hack The Box.  

Servers: Servers provide various services and applications designed to perform specific tasks. For example, one type of server might be a "web server", allowing you and others to view the content of a website (such as this section you're 
reading currently) on your computer or smartphone.  

Network: When multiple servers or computers are connected and can communicate with each other, it's called a network.  

Cloud: Cloud refers to data centers that offer interconnected servers for companies and individuals to use.  

Blue Team: This team is responsible for the internal security of the company and defends against cyber attacks.  

Red Team: This team simulates an actual adversary/attack on the company.  

Purple Team: This team consists of both Blue Team and Red Team members working together to enhance the company's security.  


Areas of InfoSec consist of, but not limited to:  


Network Security  
Application Security  
Operational Security  
Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity  
Cloud Security  
Physical Security  
Mobile Security  
Internet of Things (IoT) Security  
  
  
risk represents the potential for damage been taken, a threat is what can cause that damage, and a vulnerability is the weakness that allows the threat to cause damage.  

Roles within InfoSec:  

| Role | Description | Relevance to Pentesting |
| -----|-------------|-------------------------|
|Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Oversees the entire information security program | Sets overall security strategy that pen testers will evaluate |
|Security Architect | Designs secure systems and networks | Creates the systems that pen testers will attempt to breach|
|Penetration Tester | Identifies vulnerabilities through simulated attacks | Actively looks for and exploits vulnerabilities within a system, legally and ethically.|
|Incident Response Specialist | Manages and responds to security incidents | Often works in tandem with pen testers by responding to their attacks, and sharing/collaborating with them afterwards to discuss lessons learned. | 
| Security Analyst | Monitors systems for threats and analyzes security data | May use pen test results to improve monitoring |
| Compliance Specialist | Ensures adherence to security standards and regulations | Pen test reports often support compliance efforts |


## Principles in InfoSec  

-Confidentiality
    - Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
    - Protects against unauthorized disclosure of information
    - Implemented through measures like encryption and access controls

-Integrity
    - Maintains and assures the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle
    - Protects against unauthorized modification of information
    - Implemented through measures like hashing and digital signatures
