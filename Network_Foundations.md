# Network Foundations
`Nodes` --> Devices connected to a network. (Example: In a conversation between people it could be the actual people)  
`Links` --> The way that the nodes communicate (Example: If people are talking, exchanging notes or using Morse Signals)  
`Data Sharing` --> What is actually communicated. The data itself (Example: What is actually being told, written or signaled. It's the message that gets through)

Networks are important because they let us communicate with other devices, share data, share and access files.

##LAN/WAN  
`LAN` --> Local Area Network. Small area network where devices can have different links with each other. (Houses, Offices, Schools etc)  
`WAN` --> Wide Area Network. A big scale of networks where lots of LANs connect with each other. The biggest WAN that exists is the Internet itself.  

## Network Transmission Methods  
### OSI MODEL  

The Open Systems Interconection model is a set of rules of how two devices interact and communicate with each other.  
There are seven layers in the OSI model:  

- Physical Layer: It is everything that helps the communication to travel through devices (wires, wifi, fiber etc)  
- Data Link Layer: Gives every device a unique ID (MAC) so the devices know who they communicate with.  
- Network Layer: Finds the best path using IP Adresses
- Transport Layer: Delivers data reliably with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or quickly with UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- Session Layer: Keeps the communication session open and organized.
- Presentation Layer: Translates, encrypts, or compresses the data.
- Application Layer: The actual service you use (web, email, chat).
