# Network Foundations
`Nodes` --> Devices connected to a network. (Example: In a conversation between people it could be the actual people)  
`Links` --> The way that the nodes communicate (Example: If people are talking, exchanging notes or using Morse Signals)  
`Data Sharing` --> What is actually communicated. The data itself (Example: What is actually being told, written or signaled. It's the message that gets through)
